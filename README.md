# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maxime â€” a market finance student passionate about trading, data science, and algorithmic tools.

ðŸš€ I'm building [MLArchitect](https://github.com/maximemasson/mlarchitect), a modular Python package for efficient machine learning pipelines. It provides a plug-and-play modular architecture. Primarily developed for financial applications, it includes advanced feature engineering, selection, and integrated SHAP analysis to build predictive models quickly and efficiently.

ðŸ“Š I love working on projects related to volatility surfaces, bond pricing, and credit risk modeling.  
Check out some of my work below:

- ðŸ“ˆ [Fixed Income Fair Value Models](#) â€“ Yield curves, spreads, bond pricing  
- ðŸ¤– [Loan Default ML Models](#) â€“ Predicting credit risk with real datasets  
- ðŸŒ€ [Volatility Surface Simulation](#) â€“ Local volatility, Black-Scholes, Greeks

ðŸ’¼ Past internships at Barclays and Natixis â€” building dashboards, pricing models, and tools for fixed income trading desks.
