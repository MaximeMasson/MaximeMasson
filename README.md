# Welcome to my GitHub 👋

Hey, I'm Maxime, a student in market finance with a strong interest in quantitative research, trading strategies, and data-driven financial applications.

Here, I share my personal and academic projects, including tools I've developed to model market behavior, price derivatives, and automate analysis. I also recently released my Python package `mlarchitect`, designed to streamline the design and evaluation of machine learning pipelines in finance.

## 🔧 My Python Package: `mlarchitect`

`mlarchitect` is a flexible framework that simplifies the design, testing, and evaluation of machine learning pipelines, particularly suited for financial applications. It supports modular workflows, backtesting strategies, and custom metric evaluation.
